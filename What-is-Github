Github

Github is a webservice that works by implementing Git. Git is a software that allows version control 
and collaboration with others as a way to allow project management. This webservice works with repositories
that allow a person to upload their project for any potential collaborators to work on. This allows people to 
keep track of their changes while working together on either the main thread or a branch of it, after reaching a 
concensus they may bring everything together once it works as intended.
