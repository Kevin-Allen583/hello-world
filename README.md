# hello-world

Hi Humans!

Kevin here! I am first year Physics PhD student at Rice University, I am currently taking Phys 677 at Rice University as I 
would like to learn more about how to setup data pipelines and the process I need to follow to properly extract data and 
preprocess it for further use.

I am interested in condensed matter data, specifically related to materials design. There are a couple of datasets I am aware 
of that would be of use, these are: http://aflowlib.org/ and https://materialsproject.org/, which both have access to 
fundamental data needing to carry out material exploration and are open to the public. These datasets are not related to my 
current studies as a PhD student avoiding any conflicts with my current research.
I am interested in learning more about machine learning as this serves as a possible tool to determine what features are necessary when designing new materials. I would also like to learn about data wrangling.
